Overview
This repository contains working Python implementations of six cutting-edge AI concepts that are poised to transform the field by 2026. Each example is fully documented, executable, and demonstrates real-world applications.
üß† The Six Concepts
1. Encoder Stacking: Processing Multiple Data Types
Combines specialized modules to handle text, images, and metadata simultaneously, surpassing traditional approaches.
Applications: Trading bots, analytics systems, multimodal AI assistants
2. Self-Adapting Models: Learning in Real Time
Models that update themselves with new inputs (like slang) without losing prior knowledge.
Applications: Personalized chatbots, domain-specific AI, social media analysis
3. Reasoning Models: Step-by-Step Problem Solving
AI that shows its work, solving complex problems through explicit reasoning chains.
Applications: Educational software, financial analysis, scientific research

üî¨ What Each Example Demonstrates
1. Encoder Stacking (1_encoder_stacking.py)

Concept: Multimodal fusion architecture
